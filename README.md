# FFN-Milestone-projects
First FFN projects done after learning their working.

#1 Gratuitously Complicated Addition:
A FFN studies the data consisting of numbers from -10 and 10 to try to predict the sum of the numbers. <br>
#2 Predicting Heart Disease:
A FFN studies a modified version of the UCI heart disease dataset to figure out if based on given data a person has heart disease or not. <br>
#3 Interpolating Missing Data:
A FFN studies a self modified version of the UCI wine dataset where some rows in the residual sugar column were replaced with NaNs to figure out what data value would have fit in its place before its removal.
